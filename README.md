# README

A dynamic Ruby on Rails web application for people interested in both astrology and geopolitics.

A self-declared Minimum Viable Project 'MVP' to practice my Ruby on Rails skills using leaders, starsigns and users as models. 

What I mean by a Minimum Viable Project and the process of designing this app is included in a Medium blog post at -Â https://medium.com/@ruthnewman/my-mvps-minimum-viable-projects-e87f9c160650


The site helps the visitor assigns them a current or previous Head of Government by sharing a star sign. The seed file (db/seeds.rb and the command rails db:seed to set up), includes details of a number of leaders, their starsigns and a selection of funny images.

The home or welcome page directs to a new user view page, which creates a new user and directs to the user show page, which includes a list of links to leader show pages. There is also the ability to view starsign index pages with links to all the leaders with a specific starsign.

# Contributons

I accept and appreciate any contributions to this project as part of my ongoing learning as a Developer!

# Design

I included some basic CSS styling for this site, but this was not the emphasis of the project, and may well be improved with time.
